The Management Presence Server (MPS), a cloud-agnostic microservice, enables platforms featuring Intel® AMT to be managed over the internet. It uses an Intel vPro® feature, Client Initiated Remote Access (CIRA), for enabling edge, cloud devices to maintain a persistent connection for out-of-band manageability features, such as power control or (keyboard, video, and mouse) KVM control.
